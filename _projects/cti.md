Developed a system to extract cyber-threat intelligence, classify threat types, and rank threat events from social media text streams. The system uses PyTorch and scikit-learn, incorporating methods from GNN, NLP, and Social Network Analysis research domains. Published multiple peer-reviewed papers with accuracies up to 94.62% for CTI relevance classification.
