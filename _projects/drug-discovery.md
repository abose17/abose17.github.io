Working on an NIH-sponsored project to predict thousands of drug functionalities at scale, even with limited labeled data. The project involves developing novel approaches using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers to identify similar drug molecules based on their properties in a reverse engineering fashion.
