            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am a postdoctoral research scholar at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Kansas State (KState) University in 2022. Previously, I worked as a research assistant at the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) Lab since June 2018. I led projects in the natural language division of the lab and technical search committee. I have developed an extensive background in teaching CS courses at CS, K-State, and other universities in Bangladesh. I also served as the president of the Computer Science Graduate Student Association (CSGSA).</p>
            
            <p>I have a master's degree (2015) and a bachelor's degree (2013) in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh. During my master's degree, I was awarded a fellowship for extensive research work from the Ministry of ICT, the People's Republic of Bangladesh.</p>
            
            <p>In my research career to date, I have published 13 peer-reviewed conference papers and 2 journals, of which I am the first author of 9 conference papers. I served as a reviewer in two reputable journals (TNNLS, ETRI, and IJITDM).</p>
            
            <p>Currently, I am continuing AI/ML theoretical and applied research, such as improving graph learning representation, predicting material properties, minimizing human supervision in machine learning, social network analysis, cyber threat mining, quantum logic design, high-performance computing, etc. Besides academia and research, I also worked as a software developer at the Dutch-Bangla Bank in Bangladesh, where I took part in implementing task-specific backend applications.</p>
